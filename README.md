# FEM-Analysis

Finite element analysis repository.

This library contains generic interfaces for finite elements and solution algorithms for linear and nonlinear FE analysis.

This library uses:

- [MathNet.Numerics](https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics) for Linear Algebra operations;

- [Units.NET](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet) for simple unit conversions;

- [OnPlaneComponents](https://github.com/andrefmello91/On-Plane-Components) for stress and strain transformations;

- [Extensions](https://github.com/andrefmello91/Extensions) for some numeric extensions.
